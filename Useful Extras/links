There were many types of artists and craftsmen in the Aztec civilization, such as stone-workers, potters and feather workers.
The stone workers made rock statues and worked with green jade and other ornamental, attractive stones.
They learned their skills when they were very young and then trained other young workers.
Their tools were simple, made from wood, rock and bone.
The clay potters shaped the clay with their hands or by carving.
They didnt have a potter's wheel.
Many times they designed the inside of pots and painted them.
These beautifully painted pots were for the rich and the rulers.
The feather workers made beautiful designs for headdresses from the feathers of tropical birds.
These colourful headdresses were worn only by the noble people.
