DISTRIBUTED LEDGER
A ledger is a collection of transactions. It is not a collection of assets. Assets are part of a transaction, but the ledger records the transaction. 
With a digitally distributed ledger or a blockchain, no one owns the ledger. 
The ledger is distributed among participants in the network, all running the same blockchain protocols. 
It is decentralized in that an identical copy of the ledger exists on every node/computer on the network. 
In 2009 with the publishing of Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”, 
Bitcoin became the first application to leverage blockchain technology by recording the first asset transfer on a public blockchain ledger.


PEER TO PEER
The ledger is stored, updated, and maintained by a peer network. Nodes form the infrastructure of a blockchain network. 
They store, spread and preserve the blockchain data, so a blockchain exists on nodes. 
All nodes on a network follow the same rules of operation or protocols, but nodes have different roles. 
A full node contains a copy of the blockchain protocol, transaction history of the blockchain and aids in the maintenance of the blockchain. 
User node interacts with the ledger. With blockchain technology, a lack of a centralized authority is replaced with a peer-to-peer network.

Blockchain networks can be public or private. 
A public blockchain is open to anyone with an internet connection and the appropriate application. 
A private blockchain grants access and rights to its users before they can interact.


TRANSPARENCY
In a blockchain, we can see all the transactions that have occurred on the shared or distributed ledger. 
A blockchain stores details of every transaction that occurred since the first transfer. 
This first transfer, along with some system information that we will discuss later, becomes the first block in our chain and is referred to as the genesis block. 
Since every node shares a copy of the agreed-upon ledger, there is no friction about the transactions, everyone has the same agreed-upon copy. 
Centralized systems are not transparent, the information about the ledger is controlled by one authority.


CONSENSUS
Blockchain ledgers are different from centralized ledgers because network participants have an agreement upon what is in the identical ledger. 
In order for the blocks to be added, all the nodes in the system come to agree as to what transactions are accurate and should be added to the chain of blocks. 
Since there is no central authority telling the nodes which transactions are valid, a new way to reach agreement or come to consensus is needed.

The way in which each blockchain comes to consensus is built into the protocol, 
they are the rules built into the code that determine how the nodes will add ledger transactions. 
The Bitcoin network uses a proof of work consensus model. 
This process of building agreement among a group of mutually distrusting participants is a benefit of blockchain consensus.

ENCRYPTION
Encryption and cryptography are combined with blockchain technology to assure the information on the blockchain is authentic.
In our previous real-world example, the music sharing companies not only had legal issues from copyright infringement, 
they also could not solve the data integrity problem. 
Music downloaded from these platforms was only as reliable as the anonymous person storing and sending it. 
The data had no integrity. Cryptography and blockchain offer a secure way to prove something is authentic. 
Instead of relying on third-party, trust is put into cryptographic algorithms that prove the provenance and authenticity of an attestation.



IMMUTABILITY
Cryptography also plays a part in another powerful feature of blockchain technology, immutability. 
What makes blockchain incredibly powerful is that all the blocks are linked together. 
With the use of a cryptographic technique called hashing, 
the linked information is forged so that if you go back and try to change any data on any block anywhere in the shared ledger, 
the link with the other copies is broken in a very obvious and easy-to-determine way. 
With blockchain, there is no possibility of changing the data or altering the data inside the blockchain, it is permanent. 
In a traditional database, a system administrator oversees the ledger and can make changes.




PROGRAMABLE
Some blockchains offer an additional feature, smart contracts, that impose logic into the system. 
If you think of the Bitcoin blockchain as a calculator recording financial transactions, you can think of these blockchains as computers. 
The first of these blockchains is Ethereum, created by Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin and team. 
Ethereum runs the EVM, Ethereum Virtual Machine, which has the ability to impose digital agreements or smart contracts. 
A smart contract is a program that runs on a blockchain that can impose contractual agreements. 
Typically, they work as digital agreements that enforce a specific set of rules. 
These rules are predefined by computer code, which is replicated and executed by all network nodes. 
Blockchain smart contracts allow for the creation of trustless protocols. 
This means that two parties can make commitments via blockchain, without having to know or trust each other. 
They can be sure that if the conditions aren't fulfilled, the contract won't be executed. 
Other than that, the use of smart contracts can remove the need for intermediaries, reducing operational costs significantly.






Blockchain Developer
Developers design, write and upload smart contracts to the blockchain. 
Developer design workflows that operate with blockchains and smart contracts. 
Responsibilities can include project design, smart contract development and implementation, front end applications design and application deployment. 
Skills a developer needs can include Microsoft SQL Server, VS, .NET, MVC, AJAX, SQL, C, Py, Solidity, C++, C#, JS, Node.js, JQuery, SOAP, REST, FTP, HTML, XML, XSLT, XCOD, Neural-networks, Regression, Agile Scrum, MYSQL. 
Solutions are developed for Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, Quorum Ripple, Corda and other distributed ledger solutions.

  Approach: 
  DLT Labs along with Walmart Canada initiated a tracking program tackling the enormous problem in the freight and shipping industry of dispute resolution in disparate invoicing systems. 
  The solution connects all points on the supply chain with a shared trusted ledger. 
  This eliminates the root problems that cause invoice disputes. 
  The carriers are a vital link in Walmart's supply chain backbone, and the DLT solution ensures invoicing systems run smoothly.
  Result: 
  Demonstrable transformation of freight management and carrier relationships by implementing a shared DLT invoicing system with trust and transparency build-in, 
  reduces disputes among organization by 95%.

  Approach: 
  To make Dubai the happiest city on Earth by recreating everyday experiences for residents and visitors of Dubai, 
  making them more personalized seamless, efficient and impactful. 
  The Smart Dubai strategy will be using three essential pillars: government efficiency, industry creation and international leadership
  Result: 
  By the end of 2021, Dubai government will go completely paper-free, 
  eliminating more than one billion pieces of paper used for government transactions every day. 
  When successful, Dubai will be the first blockchain-powered government driving the future economy.



Chapter 2. Blockchain Mechanics / Understanding Ledgers
Basic Terms
  Ethereum
  Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is a decentralized open-source blockchain. 
  Unlike the Bitcoin Network, the Ethereum Protocol has the ability to run smart contracts. 
  The cryptocurrency running on the Ethereum network is called Ether.

  Smart Contracts
  A smart contract is computer code that can be run on a blockchain that executes the conditions of an agreement.

  Public Blockchains
  Public blockchain has no barrier to entry. Anyone with a cell phone and a digital wallet can transact on the blockchain.
  
  Private Blockchains
  Private blockchains or permissioned blockchains have a Membership Services piece that grants access to users before they can interact with the blockchain.

  Digital Wallet
  A digital wallet is a computer application that represents a traditional wallet. 
  It gives the user the ability to store and transact cryptocurrencies through the Internet.

  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
  Public Key Infrastructure is the identity management system for instilling trust into the electronic transfers of information or value. 
  It is the technology used to authenticate users and information by issuing a set of key pairs (public and private).
