Primitive Types
  - Boolean Data Type
  - Floating-Point Arithmetic
  - Fixed Point Numbers
  - Other Primitive Data Types 
      (Character, Integer, Reference, Enumarated Type)

Non-Primitive Types
  - Array           --> An array is a ds that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type.
  - Records
  - Union


Abstract Data Type
  - Container
  - List            --> A linear ds, in which the elements arent stored at contiguous memory locations and the elements are linked with each other.
  - Graph
  - Other Abstract Data Types include 
      (Tuple, Multimap, Set, Multiset, Stack, Queue, Double-ended Queue)
                    --> Stack: Follows LIFO(Last In First Out) principle. In this, the last element in the stack will be removed first.
                    --> Queue: Follows FIFO(First In First Out), in this, the first element stored is removed first.
                    --> Linked List: Consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
                                     Operations in Linked List
                                        - Traversal: Access each element of the linked list
                                        - Insertion: Adds a new element to the linked list
                                        - Deletion: Removes the existing elements
                                        - Search: Find a node in the linked list
                                        - Sort: Sort the nodes of the linked list
                                     
                                     Types of Linked List
                                        - Singly Linked List: Contains nodes which have a data field as well as a next field, which points to the next node in the sequence 
                                                              Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal
                                        - Doubly Linked List: Contains node which have data field, next field and another link field prev pointing to the previous node in the sequence.
                                        - Circular Linked List: Is a singly linked list in which last node, next field points to first node in the sequence
                                        - Doubly Circular Linked List: Has the features of both the circular linked list and doubly linked list..





Linear Data Structures

       Gap Buffer, Dope Vector, Circular Buffer, Zipper ..)


Tree Types
  - Binary Trees
  - Decision Trees
  - Other Tree Types include
      (B-trees, Dancing trees, Fusion trees, Heap, Leonardo Heap, Radix Tree)
            Tree: A tree is a widely used abstract data type that presents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.  


Hash Based Data Structures
  - Hash List
  - Double Hashing
  - Other include
      (Ctrie, Koorde, Minhash, Rolling Hash, DynamicPerfect Hash Table, 
       Bloom Filter, Distributed Hash Table, Count-Min Table, Rolling Hash and many more.)
            Hash Table: This is a type of ds that stores values which have keys related to each of them.


Graph
  - Multigraph
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Other types of graphss are
      (Hypergraph, Directed Graph, Scene Graph, Directed Acyclic Graph, and inventer graph and many more)
            Graph: A graph ds is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.
