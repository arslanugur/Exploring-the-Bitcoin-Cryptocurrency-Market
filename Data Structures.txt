---> Array
        An array is a collection of items that are stored sequentially.
        Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0
        
---> Linked Lists
        A linked list is a sequence of items arranged in a linear order all connected to each other
        
---> Stacks
        A stack works almost exactly as it sounds.
        It is like stacking elements with a tall container
        Stacks are known as LIFO
        (Last In First Out)

---> Queues
        A queue functions similarly to a stack, but instead of being a LIFO structure, it is a FIFO sctructure
        (First In First Out)
        
---> Hash Tables
        A hash table structure associates each value with a key and then stores them.
        Hash tables are commonly used to create database indexes
        
---> Trees
        A tree is a structure similar to a linked list because each item is linked.
        But in a tree items are linked in a hierarchal fashion, just like you might see in a visual representation of someone's family tree

---> Heaps
        A heap is a type of binary tree in which the parent nodes are compared to their children
        Heaps can be represented as trees, but they can also be represented as binary arrays
        
---> Graphs
        A graph is an abstract, non-linear data structure that is made of a finite set of nodes that are connected by edges
