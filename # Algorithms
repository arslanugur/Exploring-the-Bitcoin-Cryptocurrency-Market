# SORT
    In sort algorithms, idea is to arrange the items of a list in a specific order.
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Bucket Sort
    - Heap Sort

# SEARCH
    Find a element in a data set. There are 2 types of search algorithms
    - Binary Search
                for Linear Data Structures
    - Depth / Breath First Search
                for Graph Data Structures

# HASHING
    Hashing lookup is currently the most widely used technique to find appropriate data by key or ID. We access data by its index.

# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
    DP is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems

# DIVIDE and CONQUER
    A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly

#Â GREEDY
    We find a locally optimum solution and hope to find the optimal solution at the global level.
