---> Examples of Global Issues

Clean Water
      Water is a basic substance required for all living organisms. Without it, human health inevitably fails. 
              Su, tüm canlı organizmalar için gerekli olan temel bir maddedir. Onsuz, insan sağlığı kaçınılmaz olarak başarısız olur.
      According to a report by the United Nations, there is enough fresh water on the planet for everyone. 
              Birleşmiş Milletler'in bir raporuna göre, gezegende herkese yetecek kadar tatlı su var.
      Unfortunately, 844 million people lack access to it, and one of three people do not have access to a toilet. 
              Ne yazık ki, 844 milyon insan buna erişemiyor ve üç kişiden birinin tuvalete erişimi yok.
      Millions perish daily from unhygienic diseases due to inadequate water and sanitation. 
              Yetersiz su ve sağlık önlemleri nedeniyle hijyenik olmayan hastalıklardan her gün milyonlarca insan ölüyor.
      Governments are making efforts to assist those in need but are hindered by declining economics and disorganized infrastructures.
              Hükümetler, ihtiyacı olanlara yardım etmek için çaba sarf ediyor, ancak azalan ekonomi ve düzensiz altyapılar tarafından engelleniyor. 
      
      
Food Security
      Like water, food helps people lead healthy lives. Globally, 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished. 
              Su gibi, yemek de insanların sağlıklı yaşam sürmesine yardımcı olur. Küresel olarak, nüfusun yüzde 12,9'u yetersiz besleniyor.
      Developing countries struggle with providing an adequate food supply to their people; 
              Gelişen ülkeler, halklarına yeterli gıda arzını sağlamakta mücadele ediyor;    
      as a result, nearly 795 million people do not have enough food to meet their nutritional needs.
              Sonuç olarak, yaklaşık 795 milyon insan beslenme ihtiyaçlarını karşılamak için yeterli gıdaya sahip değil.
      The World Food Programme, a humanitarian effort established by the U.N. to combat hunger and food security, 
              Açlık ve gıda güvenliği ile mücadele amacıyla B.M. tarafından kurulan insani bir çaba olan Dünya Gıda Programı,
      is working to bring relief to developing countries, currently assisting more than 80 countries every year.
              gelişmekte olan ülkelere yardım/hafifletme/rahatlatma getirmek için çalışıyor ve şu anda her yıl 80'den fazla ülkeye yardım ediyor. 

Health
      Universal health is a growing concern. 
                    Evrensel sağlık büyüyen bir endişe kaynağıdır.
      Unfortunately, diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, smallpox and polio are still claiming the lives of thousands of people worldwide, 
                    Ne yazık ki, HIV/AIDS, sıtma, tüberküloz, çiçek hastalığı ve çocuk felci gibi hastalıklar hala dünya çapında binlerce insanın hayatına mal oluyor.
      mostly in developing nations. 
                  çoğunlukla gelişmekte olan ülkelerde.
      The World Health Organization is a global initiative that provides antibiotics and vaccinations all over the world. 
                  Dünya Sağlık Örgütü, tüm dünyada antibiyotik ve aşı sağlayan küresel bir girişimdir.
      Since its inception, polio cases have declined by 99 percent, tuberculosis treatment has saved more than 37 million people, 
                  Başlangıcından bu yana, çocuk felci vakaları yüzde 99 azaldı, tüberküloz tedavisi 37 milyondan fazla insanı kurtardı,   
      and in 2016, zero cases of Ebola were reported in West Africa.
                  ve 2016'da Batı Afrika'da sıfır Ebola vakası bildirildi. 

Human Rights
              Every person deserves basic rights, regardless of their race, sex or ethnicity. 
              In 1948, the United Nations created the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which today is commonly known as the International Human Rights Law. 
              This declaration promotes and protects human rights civilly, economically, politically and socially.

Maternal Health
              Maternal health is a global human rights issue, making it one of the key examples of global issues. 
              There are an estimated 830 pregnancy-related deaths each day. This is mainly due to lack of maternal care. 
              Women die from infections, postpartum bleeding, blood clots and other conditions. 
              The United Nations Population Fund develops relationships with governments around the world to train healthcare professionals 
              to provide expert maternal care to expecting mothers.

Girls’ Access to Education
              Girls deserve the right to learn. 
              Currently, 98 million girls do not attend school due to barriers like poverty, gender bias, governmental conflict, 
              safety concerns and a lack of educators, classrooms and curriculums. 
              Global Citizen reported that schools are sometimes hours away from where children live, making it unsafe for them to travel alone. 
              Let Girls Learn is a U.S. global strategy targeting an increase in safe access to education for girls and educators. 
              Funds are directed towards curriculums to help girls read and write.

Digital Access
              We live in a digital age where we can find all the help we need online. 
              This luxury is absent in many countries, as more than four billion people do not have access to the internet. 
              Internet connectivity would assist those living in developing countries with finding help and aid. 
              With online options, people in need can contact international aid programs to get assistance faster.

Foreign Aid Budgets
              The world would like to believe it does enough for the poor, but sadly this is not true. 
              In the U.S., the International Affairs Budget only makes up 1 percent of the federal budget. 
              Increasing the foreign aid budget is actually beneficial to the American economy. 
              It helps create more jobs in the U.S. and builds wealth in developing countries.

Women’s Rights
              Women’s rights are human rights. Women suffer discrimination in many areas: laws, the workforce and gender-based stereotypes and social practices. 
              The first conference on global feminism was held in Nairobi in 1985 and involved more than 15,000 non-governmental organizations, 
              encouraging 157 governments to adopt strategies geared towards equality, development and peace for women.

Refugees
              Refugees are people who have been forced to flee their homeland due to war, conflict and abuse. 
              Foreign countries have granted them asylum for thousands of years. 
              Refugees are sometimes denied entry into other countries, leaving them without basic human rights such as food, healthcare, education and jobs. 
              Children make up the largest percentage of refugees. 
              The U.N. Refugee Agency currently provides aid and safekeeping to 59 million refugees.
