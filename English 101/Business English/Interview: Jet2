---> Company Questions
      1--How have you gone over and above for a customer?
            I often look for opportunities to go over and above when it comes to customer service. 
            One memorable time was when a senior man was struggling to get his bags into the resort. 
            I saw him in front of the resort. I ran and greeted him, asking if I could assist. 
            After that, i had seen him a few times at the resort bar where i worked. 
            I became friends with his family and friends. 
            On the last day of his holiday, He was so thankful that he ended up going to my manager that day to compliment my kindness

      2--How would you deal with an irate customer?
            I know sometimes customers may be upset or unhappy with their experience with a particular product or service 
            and will contact the company to let them know. 
            I would acknowledge their feelings and concerns, and inform them that I would be more than happy to assist them with resolving the problem. 
            After exhausting all available resources, 
            if I could not rectify the situation, 
            I would let the customer know that I can put them in touch with a supervisor who can help them if necessary.

      3--Name 3 qualities about yourself that would make you perfect for the job?
            I am passionate about my work.
            I am ambitious and driven.
            I am highly organized.
            I'm a people-person.
            I'm a natural leader.
            I am a problem solver and results-oriented
            I am an excellent communicator.

      4---What is going to be the most challenging part of this job?
            When buyers ask a question i cannot answer. 
            This is a chance for me as the face of Jet2 to direct the customer down the right path, or, if possible, retrieve the information myself. 
            Even without a concreate answer, a question should never be met with a shrug of the shoulders.

      5---What experience do you have in assisting customers?
            I never pretend to know an answer. 
            If I'm unsure how to help a customer, I try to find out for the customer and take steps for a solution. 
            Honestly, I worked for many years in tourism. 
            So, I helped many people in resorts for easy or difficult situations 
            and if I didn't know an answer, I reached out to my co-workers or my supervisors for assistance. 
            In brief, I have self-confidence and problem-solving skills.

      6--What would you do if a passenger told you they had paid for private transport to their resort and it hadn't shown up?
            I try to do everything in my power to ensure to find what has happened to the customers transport and assist them in solving the problem. 
            If I can't solve this, I will find either a senior or other service who can.

      7---What would you do if a passenger told you they had paid for private transport to their hotel but you found out they hadn't?

            A policy and procedure would be in place for this situation 
            but I would do my best to find if something has gone wrong and assist the customer to have a nice holiday.
