# Subjunctive Verb Forms
  # Present Subjunctive
  The present subjunctive uses the base form of the verb with all subjects.
  We use the present subjunctive to talk about a present or future hypothetical

  Example:
  I suggested he stop eating out so often if he wants to save money.
                 ----> base form, not stops...
  I suggested they stop eating out so often if he wants to save money.
                 ----> base form, but you cant see the subjunctive mood...

  # Past Subjunctive
  In the past subjunctive, we use the past simple form or, with be, we use were with all subjects
         ----------------             ------------              --         ----                                      

  We use the past subjunctive to talk about things we wish were true or that we wish had happened in the past.

  We often use the past subjunctive in subordinate clauses that begin with as though, as if and if, as well as with the verb wish.
                                                                           ---------  -----     --                           ----
