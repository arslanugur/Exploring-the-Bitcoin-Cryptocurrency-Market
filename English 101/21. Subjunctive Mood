            Essay Examples:
                School boards have the power to change this situation. 
                "Were they", for example, "to mandate that every school employ" a nutritionist to oversee cafeteria offerings as well as conduct healthy eating workshops,
                "this could easily change" the reality on the ground and going forward.

                Many politicians are loath to fight climate change
                because they fear they will be blamed for the high costs of doing this
                and lose their next election battle.
                This is why "it is crucial that the electorate be supportive" of these initiatives.

                There are those who have not yet realized that "wishing one were" successful is not going to make one so;
                it is only through hard work and dedication that a person finds success.

                In my opinion, schools ought to "insist that every instructor take" additional courses throughout his or her tenure in order to keep up with the latest trends in pedagogy.

                Thus, "it is imperative that" decisions of this nature "not be left" to those unqualified to make them.

# Subjunctive Verb Forms
  # Present Subjunctive
  The present subjunctive uses the base form of the verb with all subjects.
  We use the present subjunctive to talk about a present or future hypothetical

  Example:
  I suggested he stop eating out so often if he wants to save money.
                 ----> base form, not stops...
  I suggested they stop eating out so often if he wants to save money.
                 ----> base form, but you cant see the subjunctive mood...

  # Past Subjunctive
  In the past subjunctive, we use the past simple form or, with be, we use were with all subjects
         ----------------             ------------              --         ----                                      

  We use the past subjunctive to talk about things we wish were true or that we wish had happened in the past.

  We often use the past subjunctive in subordinate clauses that begin with as though, as if and if, as well as with the verb wish.
                                                                           ---------  -----     --                           ----
