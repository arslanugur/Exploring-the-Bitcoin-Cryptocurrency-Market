--> FOR
Shows a reason or purpose. 
Using 'for' in this way can often be seen as quite formal, 
and so is usually replaced with the word 'because', 'since', or 'as'.

--> AND
Connects two similar ideas.

            I'm going to learn how to play the piano.
            
--> NOR
Now can be interchanged with 'neither' and compares a negative, contrasting Idea. 
Essentially, it is the opposite of 'and'.
      I cannot go to work, nor the doctor's.
      I'm not going to learn to play the guitar, nor the piano.

--> BUT
Compares to contrasting ideas or highlights an exception.

--> OR
Or highlights two choices.
      You can choose a blue jumper or a pink jumper.
