# VİZE TALEP DİLEKÇESİ

01.11.2022

To the Consulate General of the United Kingdom, Istanbul, Visa Department,

Dear Officer,

I, Ugur Arslan, am planning a touristic trip to your country between 23 December 2022 - 03 January 2023.
I will be seeing with my partner, Yasmin Maria Tomkins and meeting her family and seeing her every day life.

I would like to give you some information regarding my life, my job, financial status and other income.
I graduated from the English Literature department of Bulent Ecevit University in 2018 and 
I have been working a seasonal job in Marmaris in the tourism industry in summer.
I have been teaching general or exam-focused English for children and adults in a private school as a career.
I work in this job in winter.
I kindly ask you to review the bank account documents to have an idea about my annual income.

My company account at QNB Finansbank, --- covers between 01.06.2019-25.12.2019.
You will see that I earned 270.000 TL service fees within 6 months. Thus, based on this income, I extrapolated my annual income as 400.000 TL.

My personal account at Isbank, --- covers between 01.06.2019-25.12.2019.
You will see big amounts of activities in this account. 
The sources of these activities are the deposits I did over the ATM's, the monies I sent from my company account (), etc. These monies belong completely to myself, including the 50.000 TL I sent from my company account to my personal account on 24.02.2019. 

The Yapi Kredi Bank account, --- is my secondary account. 
Genellikle günlük harcamalarımı ve online harcamalarımı bu hesap üzerinden gerçekleştiririm. 
Bu hesabın kaynağı, diğer hesaplarımdan gönderilen miktarlar belirler.

The purpose of my visit is completely touristic and seeing my partner Yasmin Tomkins' life. We decided on this travel idea together with my partner,
and I wanted to see where she lives. Your country is one of the places I want to see, I, especially visit London and some familiar places if possible.
I have talked in detail about this travel with my partner, I would like to state that all expenses will be covered by me and my partner.

At the end of my trip, I shall return to my country, to my job, I kindly request that my visa inquiry is positively evaluated.

Kind regards,

Ugur Arslan
