---> Approaches to language
		Ferdinand de Saussure
				- Langue: Abstract rules and conventions of a signifying system shared by a community --- Grammar
				- Parole: Concrete act of speaking by an individual                                   --- Speaking
	          
		Noam Chomsky
				- Competence: What a person knows of language/Knowing the rules of language
				- Performance: Actual Speech Production

		Dell Hymes
		                - Communicative Competence

				1. Grammatical Competence

                                 # İki şey yapılmalı.
					1. Avoidance
					2. Compensatory Strategy
						Circumlocution:		Using multiple words to explain sth by describing its shape or function
				      	                              	- Ball: the round thing you use to play football
                                                       		      	- Lorry: the vehicle that is used to carry large things
                                                              
				                Coinage:		Using a Word that doesnt exist in the language to substite for unknown Word
					                                - zoo: animal prison
						
						Using Purpose Words:	Using some words such as thing, stuff, object to substitute of unknown word
					                                - give me that thing

                                                              		... word that is unknown
                                                              
                                                              
---> Properties of Language
		- Arbitraries (Rasgelelik)
                	No logical connection between a word and its meaning
			"Car" is named in this way arbitrarily. No reason why we call this vehicle as car
		
		- Displacement (Yer v Zaman anlamında dilin sınırı yok)
			No limitation in language in terms of time, place or object while speaking
			We can talk about past and future
			We can talk about things that are not present
			We can talk about things that cannot be seen

		- Discreteness (Farklılık/Ayrıklık)
			Every language has sounds that are unique
			Each sound in the language is different from others
			“p” and “b” are different from one another or cat, bat, eat..

		- Duality (Double Articulation) (sesler diğer seslerle birleşip sonsuz anlam oluşturur)
			The sounds in the language have two characteristics:
				they are unique
				they can be combined with other sounds to produce limitless messages

		- Cultural Transmission (Kültür Aktarımı)
			Language is transmitted to future generations by culture
			It is not transmitted genetically

		- Productivity (Creativity)
			Language allows us to produce as many sentences we want or we can
			We can talk as much as we can by language
			We can produce limitless utterances they have never been heard
			Herkes aynı resme bakarak farklı cümleler kurabilir

		- Reflexivity
			Using language to talk about itself
			Recursiveness (Uzatılarak tekrarlılık)
			Same structures of language can be used to produce longer utterances
				“I went to mall“
				“I went to mall and bought a pair of sneakers”
				“I went to mall, bought a pair of sneakers anda te pizza”
