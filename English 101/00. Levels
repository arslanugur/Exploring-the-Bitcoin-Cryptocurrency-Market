Hedging and Boosting
	Hedging is a linguistic strategy that allows speakers to soften or downplay the force of their statements
	- to seem
	- the passive voice
	- adverbs like "presumably"

		It seems like this might be a good solution

	Boosting involves using language to increase the force or impact of a statement 
	- adverbs like "undeniably"
	- strong verbs like "to prove"

		This has been proven to be the best solution to our problem.

(C1)
 Toplumsal sorunlar hakkında kendi görüş ve çözümlerini belirten yazılar/makaleler yazabilirler.

C1-C2 kursunda hızlı konu anlatımından sonraki eklenecek konular;
	Kısaltmalar (Ving, V3, to be V0, Having V3, Having been V3) yani Adjective, Noun ve bazı özel konuların Kısaltmaları Writing temelinde işlenecektir.
	Kafa karışıklığı yaratan (as, for, since, so, should, either, neither, rather, It boş öznesi vb.) kalıplar
	Vurgu yapıları incelenecektir.
	Indirect Speech (reported speech de denir) birisinin söylediği cümleyi aktarmaya denir. Genellikle konuşma dilinde kullanılır.
	Inversion; Devrik cümle
	Ayrık tümceler (Cleft Sentences).
	Extra Kalıpsal yapılar bütünüyle işlenecektir.

(C1/C2 Seviyesi Dil Bilgisi Konuları)
Extended use of previous grammar points (especially passive voice, relative clauses, noun clauses, adverbial clauses, if clauses, causatives etc.)
Participle clauses
Inversion (with negative adverbs, as, if clauses etc.)
Cleft sentences (It is Jack that broke the window, etc.) and emphasizing
Subjunctives (He suggests that my father stop smoking, etc.)



İnversions (Devrik Cümle Yapıları)
	Temel amacı cümlede vurgu yapmaktır. 
	Örneğin; “Hardly do i have milk with coffee” (kahveyi sütle içtiğim neredeyse olmamıştır). 
	Burada basitçe “I have never mik with tea” denilebilirdi ancak devrik cümle yapısı kullanılarak bu durumun karşı tarafa çarpıcı bir şekilde aktarılması yani vurgulanması gerçekleştirilmiştir.
	Bir diğer örnek; “ Scarcely did Einstein sleep more than 4 hours in a day” ( Einstein nadiren günde 4 saatten fazla uyurdu”
	Burada da yine cümleyi daha basit yapılı kurup aynı anlamı verebilirdi. Hali hazırda bakıldığında cümlenin zaten fiili vardır ve soru cümlesi de değildir, burada baştaki “did” fiili kullanılarak vurgu yapılmıştır. 

“Subjunctive” 
	konusu esas itibariyle belirli sıfat, fiil ya da isimlerden sonra “that” ile kapanan bir “noun clause” dan sonra gelen fiil her ne olursa olsun ya yalnızca “V1” ya da “Should + V1” yapısının kullanılmasıdır.
	Yani bu fiiller “that” ile kapandığında arkadaki cümle ardından gelen cümlenin yapısı her ne olursa olsun “v1” ya da “should v1” şeklinde biter. Kullanılan fiillerin neler olduğundan bahsetmek gerekirse;
	Advice
	Recommend 
	Ask
	Command
	Propose
	Order
	Require
	Request
	Desire
	Prefer
	Forbid
	Demand 
	Cümle içindeki örneklerini incelersek;

	“I advise that he should learn Spanish” (İspanyolca öğrenmesi gerektiğini tavsiye ediyorum)

	Subjunctive konusunda cümle “passive” yapıdaysa ise be+v3 kullanılır.

	“People propose that their houses should be cleaned every day” (insanlar evlerinin her gün temizlenmesi gerektiğini önerirler)

Reduction (Kısaltma)	
	Kısaltmalar cümlelerde farkında olmadan sıklıkla gördüğümüz “who-which-that” gibi bağlaçların cümle içinde kullanılmadan cümlede kısaltma yapılmasıdır.
	Örneğin “The woman who lives downstairs is making too much noise” 
	“The woman lives downstairs is making too much noise”
	Veya
	“My bag ‘which’ was more expensive than yours, faded suddenly”. Yine bu cümleden de “which” çıkarıldığında herhangi bir anlam düşüklüğü olmaz.

Linking Words
	Bir sonuç belirtirken kullandığımız “linking words” lerin en önemlileri şunlardır:

	As a result  (“ There was a heavy rain as a result there was no any taxi around.”)
	Therefore
	Thus
	Consequently
	For this reason
	As
	Since
	Due to /owing to
	As a result of
	Caused by

Daha önce öğrenilen konularda ayrıntılı olarak bilgi sahibi olmak: Özellikle passive voice, relative clauses, noun clauses, adverbial clauses, if clauses ve causatives konuları hakkında gerekli tüm çalışmalar yapılmalıdır.
Participle clauses: Fiillere –ing ekleyerek yapılan çeşitli kullanım biçimlerine verilen b2 seviye İngilizce konusudur.
Inversion: İngilizce devrik cümle kurma yöntemidir.
